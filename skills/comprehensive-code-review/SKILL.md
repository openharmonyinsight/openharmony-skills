description: Comprehensive code review system for ACE Engine (OpenHarmony ArkUI framework) covering C++, JavaScript, TypeScript, and ArkTS codebases. Performs automated analysis across 19+ dimensions: stability, performance, threading, security, memory management, Modern/Effective C++ practices, code smells, SOLID principles, design patterns, robustness, testability, maintainability, observability, API design, technical debt, and backward compatibility. Generates detailed review reports with severity levels (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW), actionable refactoring recommendations with before/after examples, and ACE Engine project-specific checks including Pattern/Model/Property separation, component lifecycle methods (OnModifyDone, OnDirtyLayoutWrapperSwap), RefPtr usage (MakeRefPtr, DynamicCast), WeakPtr for breaking cycles, and four-layer architecture compliance. Use when: (1) Reviewing pull requests or code changes, (2) Analyzing existing codebases for quality issues, (3) Enforcing coding standards and best practices, (4) Identifying technical debt and refactoring opportunities, (5) Validating architectural compliance, (6) Generating code quality reports with metrics and recommendations.

# Comprehensive Code Review for ACE Engine

## Quick Start

Perform comprehensive code review analysis directly with AI:

```
"Review the code in frameworks/core/components_ng for memory management issues"

"Analyze this pull request focusing on security vulnerabilities"

"Check path/to/code.cpp for ACE Engine architecture compliance"
```

## Review Workflow

### Phase 1: Code Analysis

AI will analyze code across all relevant dimensions based on:

1. **Reading the code files** - Understanding implementation details
2. **Applying reference standards** - Using criteria from references/ directory
3. **Checking against ACE Engine patterns** - Validating project-specific conventions

### Phase 2: Dimension-Based Review

Review code across 19+ dimensions. See [DIMENSIONS.md](references/DIMENSIONS.md) for complete coverage.

**High-Priority Dimensions:**
- Security (CRITICAL) - Input validation, command injection, buffer overflows
- Memory (CRITICAL) - Smart pointers, leaks, ownership semantics
- Threading (HIGH) - Data races, deadlocks, callback safety
- Stability (HIGH) - Error handling, boundary conditions

**Medium-Priority Dimensions:**
- Performance - Algorithm complexity, optimization opportunities
- SOLID Principles - Single responsibility, Open/Closed, etc.
- Code Smells - Long methods, large classes, duplicate code
- Testability - Dependency injection, decoupling

### Phase 3: Report Generation

AI generates comprehensive review report including:
- **Executive Summary** - Issue counts by severity
- **Critical Issues** (🔴) - Must fix before merge
- **High Priority Issues** (🟠) - Should fix before merge
- **Medium Priority Issues** (🟡) - Fix soon
- **Low Priority Issues** (🟢) - Nice to have
- **Dimension Breakdown** - Issues grouped by category
- **File-by-File Details** - Specific line numbers and code snippets
- **Recommendations** - Prioritized action items with before/after examples
- **Review Checklist** - Pre-merge verification

## ACE Engine Specific Checks

### Architecture Validation

**Four-Layer Architecture:**
```
Frontend Bridge Layer
    ↓
Component Framework Layer (Pattern/Model/Property)
    ↓
Layout/Render Layer
    ↓
Platform Adapter Layer (OHOS/Preview)
```

**Check:**
- No violations of layer boundaries
- Proper use of Pattern/Model/Property separation
- No direct platform calls from framework layer

### Component Structure

```
components_ng/pattern/<component>/
├── *_pattern.h/cpp         # Business logic & lifecycle
├── *_model.h/cpp           # Data model interface
├── *_layout_property.h/cpp # Layout properties
├── *_paint_property.h/cpp  # Render properties
└── *_event_hub.h/cpp       # Event handling
```

### RefPtr Usage

```cpp
// ✅ Creation
auto node = AceType::MakeRefPtr<FrameNode>();

// ✅ Type-safe casting
auto pattern = AceType::DynamicCast<MenuPattern>(node->GetPattern());
if (!pattern) {
    LOGE("Failed to get pattern");
    return false;
}

// ✅ Breaking cycles with WeakPtr
class Child {
    WeakPtr<Parent> parent_;  // Use weak, not strong
};

// ✅ Safe callbacks
auto weak = AceType::WeakClaim(this);
PostTask([weak]() {
    auto pattern = AceType::DynamicCast<MenuPattern>(weak.Upgrade());
    if (pattern) pattern->Update();
});
```

### Naming Conventions

```cpp
class MenuPattern {           // PascalCase
public:
    void OnModifyDone();      // PascalCase
    int GetWidth() const;     // Get prefix

private:
    int width_;               // snake_case_ with trailing underscore
    std::string component_id_;  // Abbreviations lowercase
};

constexpr int MAX_MENU_ITEMS = 100;  // UPPER_CASE
```

## Severity Levels

**🔴 CRITICAL** - Must fix before merge
- Security vulnerabilities (command injection, buffer overflow)
- Memory leaks in long-running processes
- Use-after-free, double-free
- Data races
- Crashes / undefined behavior
- Architecture violations

**🟠 HIGH** - Should fix before merge
- Performance degradation
- API violations
- SOLID principle violations
- Major code smells (Large Class, Shotgun Surgery)
- Improper RefPtr usage
- Unsafe callback captures

**🟡 MEDIUM** - Fix soon
- Minor performance issues
- Code smells (Long Method, Duplicate Code)
- Style violations
- Missing error handling in non-critical paths

**🟢 LOW** - Nice to have
- Missing comments
- Minor style issues
- Optimization opportunities
- Code documentation improvements

## Common Issue Patterns

| Pattern | Dimension | Severity | Detection |
|---------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| Raw pointer instead of RefPtr | Memory | HIGH | `new T()` without RefPtr |
| Command injection | Security | CRITICAL | `system(user_input)` |
| Buffer overflow | Security | CRITICAL | `strcpy()`, `sprintf()` |
| Unsafe this capture | Threading | HIGH | `[this]` in PostTask |
| Long method (>50 lines) | Code Smell | MEDIUM | Function length |
| Large class (>500 lines) | Code Smell | HIGH | Class size |
| Missing null check | Stability | HIGH | Pointer use without validation |
| static_cast instead of DynamicCast | Memory | MEDIUM | `static_cast<T*>` |

## Usage Examples

### Review a Pull Request

```
"Review the changes in this PR with focus on memory management and threading safety"
```

AI will:
- Analyze all changed files
- Check memory management (RefPtr, WeakPtr, raw pointers)
- Verify threading safety (callback captures, PostTask usage)
- Report issues with line numbers and severity

### Security Audit

```
"Perform a security audit of path/to/code, focusing on input validation and potential vulnerabilities"
```

AI will check for:
- Command injection risks (system() calls)
- Buffer overflow vulnerabilities (strcpy, sprintf)
- Unvalidated user input
- Unsafe type casts

### Memory Leak Detection

```
"Analyze frameworks/core/components for potential memory leaks and improper RefPtr usage"
```

AI will identify:
- Raw new/delete without smart pointers
- Circular references without WeakPtr
- Missing null checks after DynamicCast
- Improper ownership semantics

### Architecture Compliance Check

```
"Verify that components_ng/menu follows the four-layer architecture and Pattern/Model/Property separation"
```

AI will validate:
- Four-layer architecture compliance
- Pattern/Model/Property separation
- No layer boundary violations
- Component lifecycle methods (OnModifyDone, etc.)

## Integration Examples

### Pre-commit Hook

For pre-commit hooks, consider using traditional static analysis tools:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit

CHANGED_FILES=$(git diff --cached --name-only --diff-filter=ACM | grep -E '\.(cpp|cc|cxx|h|hpp|ts|tsx)$')

if [ -n "$CHANGED_FILES" ]; then
    echo "Running basic static analysis..."
    # Use clang-tidy, cppcheck, eslint, etc.
    for file in $CHANGED_FILES; do
        if [[ $file == *.cpp || $file == *.h ]]; then
            clang-tidy $file --checks='*' || true
        elif [[ $file == *.ts ]]; then
            eslint $file || true
        fi
    done
fi
```

### Manual Review Workflow

For comprehensive AI-powered review:
1. Identify code to review (PR, specific files, directory)
2. Request review with specific focus areas
3. AI analyzes code using reference standards
4. Review results with severity-tagged issues
5. Address critical and high-priority issues
6. Re-request review for verification
